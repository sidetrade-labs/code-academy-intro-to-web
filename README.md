# Sidetrade's Code Academy - Intro to Web

Welcome to the second part of Sidetrade's Code Academy course!

## Setting up

### Use template

Once you're logged in with your GitHub account, you should be able to click the "Use this template" button.

When you click this, you will  be able to name your repository and create your own copy.

### Opening with Gitpod

Gitpod builds you a development environment right in your browser so that we don't need to setup and install all the different components/parts of a toolkit that a developer may need. It helps to make this part as accessible as possible so that we don't have to worry different laptop setups & installation problems, all you need is Google Chrome, a Chrome Extension & a GitHub account.

By clicking the above link & installing Gitpod, you should now be able to go to your repository and open it within Gitpod without actually installing anything on your machine.

# Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
